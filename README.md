### Database Structure
This section describes the database structure implemented in the data lake, which consists of various main databases adapted to the different stages of data processing and analysis.
- Raw Database: Initial landing area for raw, unprocessed data from various sources.
- Stream Database: Real-time data processing and analysis for streaming data.
- BI Database: Optimized for business intelligence and analytics.

### Compute (raw data to BI database)
The compute process involves a few stages of data transformation and processing to ensure that raw data is refined, aggregated, and prepared for business intelligence and analytics purposes.

### Dashboards
This section presents various dashboards and data analysis projects created with different visualisation and analysis tools. These dashboards provide information on various pre-processed datasets.
